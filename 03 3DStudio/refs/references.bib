@book{Bonda2007,
abstract = {A step-by-step guide to designing environmentally friendly commercial interiors.Millions of people in the U.S. workforce rely on interior designers to create environments that make them happy and productive, as well as promote their safety and well-being. Sustainable Commercial Interiors provides an engaging introduction to and exploration of the vast field of sustainable design as it specifically relates to commercial interior spaces.In Sustainable Commercial Interiors, coauthors Penny Bonda, a noted expert on interior design and sustainability, and Katie Sosnowchik, an interior design editor and innovator, share their passion for environmental advocacy while offering designers and architects the technical knowledge important for success in this evolving discipline. The authors apply the concept of environmental responsibility to the design of interiors, and employ the organization of the LEED Green Building Rating System(r) to sort the design process into five categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy issues, materials, and indoor environmental quality.Chapters explore: In-depth information about interior finishes and furnishings, Best contemporary examples of sustainable commercial interior design projects, including photos and drawings of the design, Outside-the-boundaries thinking about sites, water, and energy issues, Materials, with a strong emphasis on life-cycle thinking, Indoor environmental quality, including acoustics, thermal comfort, daylighting, and views,> Green design tools, including standards, certification programs, and specifications,Based on the premise that designers, with their power to create, have responsibilities beyond others, Sustainable Commercial Interiors is a vital tool for both novice and veteran green-minded practitioners.},

@book{Piotrowski2013,
abstract = {The definitive reference on designing commercial interiors-expanded and updated for today's facilitiesFollowing the success of the ASID/Polsky Prize Honorable Mention in 1999, authors Christine Piotrowski and Elizabeth Rogers have extensively revised this guide to planning and designing commercial interiors to help professionals and design students successfully address today's trends and project requirements. This comprehensive reference covers the practical and aesthetic issues that distinguish commercial interiors. There is new information on sustainable design, security, and accessibility-three areas of increased emphasis in modern interiors.An introductory chapter provides an overview of commercial interior design and the challenges and rewards of working in the field, and stresses the importance of understanding the basic purpose and functions of the client's business as a prerequisite to designing interiors. This guide also gives the reader a head start with eight self-contained chapters that provide comprehensive coverage of interior design for specific types of commercial facilities, ranging from offices to food and beverage facilities, and from retail stores to health care facilities. Each chapter is complete with a historical overview, types of facilities, planning and interior design elements, design applications, a summary, references, and Web sites. New design applications covered include spas in hotels, bed and breakfast inns, coffee shops, gift stores and salons, courthouses and courtrooms, and golf clubhouses.In keeping with the times, there are new chapters focusing on senior living facilities and on restoration and adaptive use. A chapter on project management has been revised and includes everything from proposals and contracts to scheduling and documentation. Throughout the book, design application discussions, illustrations, and photographs help both professionals and students solve problems and envision and implement distinctive designs for commercial interiors.With information on licensing, codes, and regulations, along with more than 150 photographs and illustrations, this combined resource and instant reference is a must-have for commercial interior design professionals, students, and those studying for the NCIDQ licensing exam.Companion Web site: www.wiley.com/go/commercialinteriors},

@book{Hansen2012,
abstract = {The intent of this book is to provide the interior design student a well-rounded knowledge of Autodesk Revit tools and techniques. These skills can then be applied to enhance professional development in both academia and industry.The overall premise of the book is to learn Revit Architecture while developing the interior of a two story law office. The reader is provided an architectural model with established columns, beams, exterior walls, minimal interior walls and roofs in which to work. This allows more emphasis to be placed on interior design rather than primary architectural elements. The chapters chronology generally follows the typical design process. Students will find this book helps them more accurately and efficiently develop their design ideas and skills.The first chapter introduces the reader to Revit, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the basics of opening, saving and creating a new project. The second provides a quick introduction to modeling basic elements in Revit including walls, doors, windows and more. This chapter is designed to show students how powerful Revit is and hopefully make them more excited about learning it.The remainder of the book is spent developing the interior space of the law office with an established space program. A student will learn how to view and navigate within the provided 3D architectural model, managing and creating materials and develop spaces with walls, doors and windows. Once all the spaces are added to the model, several areas are explored and used as the basis to cover Revit commands and workflows.At the end of this tutorial, the reader will be able to model floor finishes, ceilings with soffits, casework, custom reception desk, restrooms, furniture and light fixtures. Additional features such as tags, schedules and photo-realistic rendering will be covered.},
